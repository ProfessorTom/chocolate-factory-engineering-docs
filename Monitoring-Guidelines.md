# Monitoring Guidelines for Dashboards

1. The most important data should be the most prominent, and less important data should be consistently less prominent
2. Graphs with more than five plots are rarely useful.
3. Consoles with a large number of graphs are difficult to navigate (6/console as a guideline).
4. Consoles should always use the same layout.
5. Graphs should have markers showing limits (e.g. for where things go out of SLO)
